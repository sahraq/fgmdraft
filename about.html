Most undergo FGM between ages <strong>5 and 11</strong>. The most common type practiced is Type III (infibulation), which involves the most severe form of cutting.</p>

    <p>The practice poses significant health risks, contributing to increased maternal and newborn mortality rates. Women who have undergone FGM are more likely to suffer complications during childbirth, including hemorrhaging and obstructed labor, leading to higher rates of maternal deaths.
