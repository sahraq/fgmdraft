    <h1>Female Genital Mutilation</h1>
    <h2>What is FGM?</h2>
    
    <p>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures involving the removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is most often carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15.</p>

    <h2>Why is FGM a Concern?</h2>
    <p>FGM poses severe health risks, including chronic pain, infections, complications during childbirth, and even death. The procedure is often performed in unsanitary conditions without anesthesia, leading to immediate and long-term physical consequences.</p>

    <h2>Why is FGM practiced?</h2>
    <p>FGM is deeply entrenched in the cultural and societal fabric of many communities. It is often viewed as a rite of passage, symbolizing purity, modesty, and a girl's readiness for marriage. In some societies, there is immense social pressure to conform to these practices, as families fear ostracization or rejection if they do not comply. Additionally, FGM is frequently tied to beliefs about femininity and social status, perpetuating the cycle of gender inequality.</p>

    <h2>Global Prevalence</h2>
    <p>FGM is prevalent in many parts of Africa, the Middle East, and some regions of Asia. According to the World Health Organization, over 200 million women and girls worldwide have undergone this procedure, with a significant number in Somalia, where the practice is deeply rooted in cultural traditions.</p>
